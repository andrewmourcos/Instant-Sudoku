# Instant-Sudoku

If you place a printed sudoku game in front of your laptop's camera and run my code, it should be able to solve the game for you.

It's using a dataset that I collected myself in /Custom-Dataset, but you can also train the SVM model using a dataset I found online in /Dataset.

Uses OpenCV to get images of the sudoku game and a supervised machine learning algorithm (an SVM) to recognize the digits in the sudoku game.
